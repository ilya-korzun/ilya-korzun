Hello! My name is Ilya Korzun. I am a high school senior and an international student from Belarus, aspiring to pursue a college education in Computer Science (Software Engineering) and Politics.

My journey into Computer Science began in 2020, when I participated in my first programming hackathon organized by EPAM. Along with a team of peers, we built a medical assistant robot capable of delivering medications, analyzing patient data, and offering care recommendations. After securing 1st place in the final stage of the hackathon, I continued my path in web development and web design, which led to my first freelance job at the age of 13.

To this day, I have completed dozens of freelance projects across various areas of programming and design, and have received more than 15 awards in tech competitions and contests. I specialize in Front-End Development and UX/UI Design. 

My passion is to create unique projects that are not only visually appealing but also optimized for maximum user convenience. My approach to project creation is based on deep analysis of user needs and constant study of new trends in development and design. My goal is not just to create aesthetically pleasing interfaces, but to develop effective solutions that address specific tasks of your business.
